# Huffman
A Huffman tree generator in Javascript with code creation, encryption and decryption. Try it on the [Github Page](https://tiwenty.github.io/Huffman/src/).

## What does it do?
It waits for the user to fill what characters he wants in his code, and at what frequency. The user can then create the tree and the resulting binary codes are displayed.  
The user then has the possibilty to encrypt a string. If a character isn't found in the tree, it'll be ignored. When this occurs, a summary table shows what characters were missed.  
Finally, it is possible to decrypt a string.

## Why did I do it?
I mainly did it after a class at school where we were taught about the Huffman tree and I thought it'd be a fun exercise to make a small application of it.
